<div class="w3-container w3-red w3-large">
<p>Here I have given a lot of data compiled in easy language about formula 1(cars only).
This page is for beginners only and covers a wide range of things(in easy language obviously) about basics car design(aero, power unit components)</p>

1. Aero:-
</div>
<div class="w3-container w3-white w3-large">
<p> Aerodynamics is the word you will hear all the paddock crying and moaning about. In the modern age of f1 aero is as important as the wheels or the engine.
Aero is what separates f1 from everything else. The Aero department is responsible for things from all aspects. You may think aero is important for creating downforce, but that is only one aspect.
It is responsible for how efficiently you create downforce. You need maximum downforce in corners while delivering minimum downforce in straights but it only slows the car down thereby decreasing
the top speed leaves you a sitting duck. Teams used flexible materials(carbon fibre) which bends in straights and comes up to create downforce. Also, you will find them talking about different aero 
packages. That just means that teams will develop different (mostly front and rear wings) most commonly you can see the difference in downforce levels of a Monaco rear wing(
massive rear wings for high downforce, lower top speed but higher cornering speeds ) and Monza rear wings(skinny rear wings for low downforce, top speed but lower cornering speed).
Other than that it can affect how fast you wear your tyres(for example slower cars can run through their tread faster than faster cars), it can affect your fuel consumption, how quickly you
warm up your tyres, how much cooling you provide to your tyres, how much your car understeers or oversteers, and a whole variety of other things.</p>

2. Power unit:-
</div>
<div class="w3-container w3-white w3-large">
<p> A formula 1 power unit is nothing like a normal engine in your car. It is composed of 6 components that can produce upwards of 1000 horsepower. It is the most expensive component of a car even 
though teams are limited in the number of power unit components they can use throughout the season. Not to mention teams used to burn through engines in a season (seriously hundreds of engines
sometimes). Not to mention they are the most efficient engines in the world. Reaching an unbelievable 50% efficiency. But the components used nowadays are as follows:-<br><br>
<div class="w3-container w3-xlarge">1. Internal combustion engine:-<br></div>
Internal combustion engine or commonly referred to as ICE, it is a turbocharged 1.6 litres V6-engine that can rev up to 15000 RPMs. Max of 3 components per season.<br><br>
<div class="w3-container w3-xlarge">2.Motor generator unit-heat (MGU-H):-<br></div>
The Motor Generator Unit - Heat (usually abbreviated as MGU-H) is a hybrid-electric internal combustion engine component.
The unit is an evolved component of a turbocharger, where the exhaust gasses (the "heat" part of the name) are used to also generate electricity, and the unit also functions as a motor.
It will be removed from 2026 regulations. Max of three components per season.<br><br>
<div class="w3-container w3-xlarge">3.Motor generator unit-kinetic (MGU-K):-<br></div>
It is used to generate electric power from the car's kinetic energy. Primarily used during breaking to generate power from braking instead of that power dissipating as heat during braking.
It can also use that energy to add horses during straights to increase top speed. This is also a big reason for doing out laps in qualifying, they are using MGU-K to store energy and fill up the
battery for the qualifying lap. This is getting bigger from 2026 regulations. Maximum of 3 per season.<br><br>
<div class="w3-container w3-xlarge">4.Turbocharger:-<br></div>
A turbocharger is a device to force additional air into an internal combustion engine. The additional air increases the engine's power and efficiency to the point where most racing series
 have separate regulations or classes for turbocharged engines. Maximum of 3 per season.<br><br>
<div class="w3-container w3-xlarge">5.Energy store (ES):-<br></div>
This is the battery pack used to store energy in f1. It stores the energy recovered from MGU-H and MGU-K.Maximum of 2 per season.<br><br>
<div class="w3-container w3-xlarge">6.Control electronics (CE):-<br></div>
It is basically the computer that is used to control all the deployment and storage of energy and a lot of other components. Maximum of 2 per season.<br><br>

Along with that you also have 8 allowed exhaust systems per season.<br>
